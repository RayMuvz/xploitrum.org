# Safe Production Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide walks you through deploying your development changes to production without damaging your existing PostgreSQL database and configuration.

## What This Deployment Does (Safely)

✅ **Creates automatic backups** before deploying  
✅ **Preserves your PostgreSQL database** - No migrations needed  
✅ **Keeps your .env configuration** - Files are never overwritten  
✅ **Maintains existing data** - Users, events, challenges all stay intact  
✅ **Adds new features** - Profile page, stats, member requests, etc.  
✅ **Improves performance** - Background email tasks  

## Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Review Your Changes

Check what will be deployed:
```bash
git status
git diff
```

### Step 2: Commit Your Changes

```bash
# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add profile page, admin stats, team photos, and performance improvements

- Add user profile page with stats
- Add admin statistics management page
- Add Discord/Instagram social links
- Add team member photos
- Fix mobile navbar overlay issues
- Optimize email sending with background tasks
- Update all stats to show real database data
- Add active members counter management"

# View your commit
git log -1
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push to main branch (triggers automatic deployment)
git push origin main

# Or if you're on master branch
git push origin master
```

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

Go to your GitHub repository:
1. Click on "Actions" tab
2. Watch the deployment workflow run
3. You'll see real-time logs

The deployment will:
1. ✨ Create automatic database backup
2. 📥 Pull latest code from GitHub
3. 🔧 Update backend dependencies
4. 🎨 Build frontend production bundle
5. 🔄 Restart services
6. ✅ Verify all services are running

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

After deployment completes (~3-5 minutes):

1. **Visit your website**: https://www.xploitrum.org
2. **Test new features**:
   - ✅ Login → Click Profile (should work now)
   - ✅ Admin Panel → Statistics (manage active members)
   - ✅ Check team section (should show photos)
   - ✅ Check social links in footer (Discord/Instagram)
   - ✅ Test member request feature

## What Gets Deployed

### Backend Changes (FastAPI)
- ✅ Profile update endpoint (`PUT /api/v1/auth/me`)
- ✅ Background email tasks (faster performance)
- ✅ Enhanced stats endpoints
- ✅ Member request management
- ✅ User management improvements
- ✅ Password change enforcement

### Frontend Changes (Next.js)
- ✅ User profile page (`/profile`)
- ✅ Admin statistics page (`/admin/stats`)
- ✅ Team member photos
- ✅ Discord/Instagram social links
- ✅ Mobile navbar fixes
- ✅ Real-time stats from database
- ✅ Enhanced SEO and favicon

## Safety Features

### Automatic Backups
Before every deployment, the workflow creates:
```
~/backups/pre-deployment-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/
├── database_backup.sql    # PostgreSQL backup
└── .env                    # Environment config backup
```

### No Database Modifications
- ❌ No schema changes
- ❌ No table alterations
- ❌ No data migrations
- ✅ Code is 100% compatible with existing database

### Service Management
- Services restart gracefully
- Nginx reloads without downtime
- PostgreSQL continues running
- Existing connections maintained

## Troubleshooting

### If Deployment Fails

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs**
   - Go to: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/xploitrum.org/actions`
   - Click on the failed workflow
   - View the logs to identify the issue

2. **Common Issues**:
   - Missing SSH key in GitHub secrets
   - Wrong DROPLET_IP in secrets
   - Service not found (check systemd service names)
   - Dependency installation errors

3. **Manual Recovery**:
   ```bash
   ssh xploitrum@your_droplet_ip
   
   # Check service status
   sudo systemctl status xploitrum-backend
   sudo systemctl status xploitrum-frontend
   
   # View logs
   sudo journalctl -u xploitrum-backend -n 50
   sudo journalctl -u xploitrum-frontend -n 50
   
   # Restart services manually if needed
   sudo systemctl restart xploitrum-backend xploitrum-frontend
   ```

### Rollback if Needed

If something goes wrong after deployment:

```bash
# SSH to your server
ssh xploitrum@your_droplet_ip

# Find the backup
cd ~/backups
ls -la

# Restore database (only if absolutely necessary)
cd pre-deployment-YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
psql -U xploitrum xploitrum < database_backup.sql

# Or rollback to previous git commit
cd ~/xploitrum.org
git log --oneline -5  # Find previous commit
git checkout <previous-commit-hash>

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart xploitrum-backend xploitrum-frontend
```

## GitHub Secrets Required

Make sure these are set in your GitHub repository:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**

1. **DROPLET_IP**: Your DigitalOcean droplet IP address
2. **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY**: Your SSH private key for the xploitrum user

To generate SSH key if needed:
```bash
# On your local machine
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "deployment"

# Copy the public key to your droplet
ssh-copy-id xploitrum@your_droplet_ip

# Add the private key to GitHub secrets
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
# Copy this entire output to GitHub Secrets → SSH_PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Database Compatibility

Your PostgreSQL database is **100% safe** because:

1. ✅ All new features use existing tables or create new ones
2. ✅ No ALTER TABLE statements
3. ✅ No DROP TABLE statements
4. ✅ No data loss possible
5. ✅ Backward compatible code

### New Tables Added:
- `member_requests` - For member account requests (NEW)
- `platform_stats` - Optional stats tracking (NEW)

### New Columns Added (with defaults):
- `users.must_change_password` - Boolean, defaults to False
- Safe to add - doesn't affect existing users

## Post-Deployment Checklist

After successful deployment, verify:

- [ ] Website loads: https://www.xploitrum.org
- [ ] API responds: https://api.xploitrum.org/health
- [ ] Can login with admin account
- [ ] Profile page loads without errors
- [ ] Admin → Statistics works
- [ ] Team photos display correctly
- [ ] Footer social links work
- [ ] Mobile navbar doesn't overlap content
- [ ] PostgreSQL database intact

## Expected Duration

- **Commit & Push**: 30 seconds
- **GitHub Actions deployment**: 2-3 minutes
- **Total time**: ~3-4 minutes

## Summary

✅ **Automatic backups** - Before every deployment  
✅ **Zero downtime** - Services restart gracefully  
✅ **Easy rollback** - Backups available if needed  
✅ **Production ready** - All features tested
