# Simplified GitHub Actions Deployment Setup

Since SSH key authentication is causing issues, let's use an alternative approach.

## Option 1: Use Personal Access Token (Simpler)

Instead of SSH keys, we can use a GitHub Personal Access Token to clone/pull code.

## Option 2: Manual Deployment Script

Let's create a script that you run manually on the server when you want to deploy.

## Option 3: Use Existing Working SSH Key

Since you can SSH to your server successfully, let's extract your existing key and use that for GitHub Actions.

### Steps:

1. **From your local machine, get your existing working SSH public key:**
   ```powershell
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   # or
   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
   ```

2. **The private key should already be in GitHub Secrets under SSH_PRIVATE_KEY**

3. **Remove the deployment@xploitrum key and use your existing key instead**
